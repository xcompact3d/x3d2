If you are looking to take part in the project but don't have anything specific in mind, you could consider:

- Reporting bugs, suggesting improvements, or sharing user experiences.
- Adding documentation or improving the current documentation.
- Working on fixing issues or implementing new features.

In any of the cases above, your entry point should be the `issue tracker <https://github.com/xcompact3d/x3d2/issues>`_ -- either to pick an existing issue to work on or to create a new one.

For detailed information about the source code, refer to the `API documentation <https://xcompact3d.github.io/x3d2>`_ generated by FORD. This documentation provides insights into the codebase and can help you understand the structure and functionality of the project.
